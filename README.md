# SMART-ATTENDANCE

It’s a simple application to take attendance using
real time face detection. It will be developed using Convolutional Neural Networks
and will be in Python. It is used to point the camera at the person's face and the
application will read the face pixel by pixel and give correct results even in case of
change of hairstyle or specs. Hence, turning the phone once around the classroom can
take the attendance of everyone, thus saving time and fake proxies. The application
enrolls the subject’s face into the database against the subject’s Unique Id and Name.
The application then gives the attendance to the recognized faces in the database.
